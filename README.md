1. Implement a simple library management system. The system should allow adding, removing, and searching for books. Each book should have properties like Title, Author, ISBN, and Publication Year.

2. Write a C# program that creates multiple threads to calculate the factorial of different numbers concurrently. Ensure thread safety and proper synchronization.

3. Implement a producer-consumer scenario using a Queue. The producer should generate random numbers and add them to the queue, while the consumer should read and print these numbers.

4. Create a C# application that connects to a SQL database using Entity Framework. Implement CRUD operations for a simple Customer entity with properties like CustomerID, Name, Email, and PhoneNumber.

5. Develop a RESTful API using ASP.NET Core that manages a collection of Products. The API should support operations to create, read, update, and delete products. Each product should have properties like ProductID, Name, Description, and Price.

6. Write a C# console application that consumes a public REST API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API). The application should fetch and display the current weather information for a given city.
